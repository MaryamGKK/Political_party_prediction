# Political_party_prediction
The data set available is based on the U.S. congress voting record
from 1984. The data set consists of the votes (yes or no) on sixteen issues for each of
the 435 members of congress. from the voting record. I used this data to create a
decision tree that predicts the political party of the representative based on his /her vote .
